# Gravitational Force Test
Use this website to experiment with the amount of force a spaceship gets from the earth and moon at different distances.

## Challange
1. Try to find a distance from the earth, where the graviational force from the earth is equal to the graviational force from the moon.
2. Now try do that mathematically! (Tip, use Newton's law of universal gravitation)
